                Money begets money. If you don't have that, you wait around to be
                hired by somebody at the mercy of others. If you have that money in
                your hand, you desperately try to make the best use of it and move
                ahead. And that's generating income for yourself. The developing world
                is full of entrepreneurs and visionaries, who with access to
                education, equity and credit would play a key role in developing the
                economic situations in their countries.
